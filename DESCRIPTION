Description: A varied array of mathematical derivations from various titrimetric and colorimetric methods for analyzing water quality parameters were condensed and integrated for the better physicochemical analysis. It is indispensable for managing any aquatic ecosystem, including aquaculture facilities. By substituting titrant and spectrophotometric absorbance readings, accurate determination of the concentrations of critical parameters such as Dissolved Oxygen, Free Carbon Dioxide, Total Alkalinity, Water Hardness, Hydrogen Sulfide, Total Ammonia Nitrogen, Nitrite, Nitrate, Chlorinity, Salinity, Inorganic Phosphate, and Transparency can be facilitated APHA(2017,ISBN:9780875532875).
